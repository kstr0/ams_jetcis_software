 Cross-compiling the samples
====================================

Before cross-compiling the sample, the user must ensure that all the required environment for 
its toolschain is configure properly. It must also define the environment variables CC, CXX and LD
to point to you gcc, g++ and ld version of the toolschains.
The bin/set_puregev_env.sh must be sourced to define the configuration / location of the SDK as well.
